# League of Bullies — Season 1 (Static Site)

This site is split into **multiple ZIP files**. To assemble:

1. Create a folder on your machine named `LEAGUEOFBULLIES-SEASON1`.
2. Extract **all** the ZIPs from this delivery **into that same folder** (allow merge/overwrite).
3. Commit that folder to your GitHub repo (root recommended for GitHub Pages or Vercel).

Zips:
- `LOB_site_core.zip` — HTML/CSS/JS + empty `assets/` stub
- `LOB_assets_part1.zip` — Base dog images (JAX, ASIA, MS.EUROPE)
- `LOB_assets_part2.zip` — Capone, logo, Asia×Exodus flyer
- `LOB_assets_part3.zip` — Puppies gallery + CashApp QR
- `LOB_video.zip` — Preloader video (if available in your upload)

> Missing assets will be replaced with labeled placeholder images so the site still builds and runs.
